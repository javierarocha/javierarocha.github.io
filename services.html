                <div class="h-10"></div>
                <p>Every digital product must be treated like any custom product. I do follow the kick off idea until its implementation (Web or App). Solutions to problems, the optical ones. Reach for the value for users in orden to reach value for Clients.</p>

                <div class="h-10"></div>
                <p>Users are the key for every digital product, without any exception. Study them, understand them, analyse and learn from them – this is the only way a designer could solve any kind of problem in front of him/her. This is my mindset.</p>

                <div class="h-10"></div>
                <p>Some people say: „It doesn't matter how it looks, it only matters how it works“. I'm pretty sure that they're wrong. This is what a professional with no sense for values would say. A Ferrari isn't a Ferrari only for its motor, it‘s about its design, too. This beautiful blend has an incredible and aesthetic design with his motor, which is a very valuable engineering. This is how I think every time that I design, it has to be the best design in the users‘ hearts and mine.</p>

                <div class="h-10"></div>
                <p>Everyone needs a complement in their life, which is why +12 years ago, I began to study Design & Development and started to work with it. The front-end development is giving me the possibility to develop and design at the same time. I do know how this design has to be implemented with every clean and beautiful letter in a code with technologies like HTML, JavaScript, CSS, SASS, REACT, SWIFT. Frameworks like Bootstrap, Grid, Material UI, ONE UI, Stylus, Slim and more.</p>

                <div class="h-10"></div>
                <p>It’s just a word to make people understand all the years of having worked in this area. In a moment, you realize that you have been specializing in many ways in your professional career. But no, there's always more and more to learn: Researching, designing, templating with code, experiences from projects and the love of my job makes me in a way a full stack designer with a strong energy to solve problems and keep on learning from them.</p>
